  - If the state doesn't regulate firms from becoming too big, then the firms themselves become the regulators. They get to decide who enters the markets. They get to decide how people conduct their lives, etc...
- 'I have lived in the US my entire life.  We have laws here which have been on the books for over a hundred years regarding anittrust commercial businesses (monopolies) and the laws were used to breakup monolopies in the past, e.g. ATT and IBM.  But now our federal government refuses to use these laws to break up monopolies here in the US because of money in our politics and SCOTUS rulings since 2000 ("Citizens United" which is an oxymoron).  This combined with the dumbing-down of the public by interested parties (mostly Republicans) trying to tear down the public schools here for the past 40 years.  We, i.e. the public, have a lot of work to do here to get our government back on track to start doing what is in the public interest and not what is in the interest of the Super Rich (billionaires / oligarchs)  here in the US.'.
  - Need to read more about the history of monopolies.
  - Is this why EU companies aren't able to compete with US monopolies?
